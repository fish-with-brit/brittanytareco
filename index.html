        Hi Everyone !!

        Hope all is well and everyone is enjoying their week. I have been going through all my messages and decided to write a blog on some of the questions I have received from all of you.
        
        So here it goes :
        
        I am 32 years old, a mother of two beautiful girls. I am a resident of Spring Hill, Tennessee and Destin, Florida. I travel back and forth to Destin every other week to work for my company, Hook’D Charters! I literally work my dream job in one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. The beaches are absolutely beautiful with sand as white of snow and the Emerald Coast’s water is the most gorgeous colors of teals, blues, and greens. The drive back and forth really isn’t that bad since I have been doing it for almost 3 years now. It’s about 5.5 hours, but feels like 3. Unless I hit traffic lol. It’s so cool to receive messages like “HEY! I just saw you on I-65”. I love it! Honk if you pass me, well if you can catch me.
        
        
        My company is an inshore and deep seas fishing charter with three awesome center consoles. A 24Ft Yellowfin Bay Boat, and 26Ft Yellowfin Hybrid and a 36Ft Yellowfin. These boats are equipped with the best of the best! The goal is to give my clients the very best experience while they are aboard any of the boats! I am a first mate aboard the 36Ft for offshore trips and absolutely love the opportunity to fish along side my clients, teaching them new things and helping them load an ice box full of fish! I have been fishing in Destin going on 8 years. I am a huge lover of saltwater fishing and my passion for the sport definitely shows through when I am on the boat! I still have a lot to learn and enjoy learning new things each day that I am out there.
        
        
        My favorite trips are our trips targeting the Pelagic Species such as Wahoo, Blackfin Tuna, Mahi, Swordfish, Golden Tile, and Marlin! These trips are so hype and so many styles of fishing take place while we are out there. High speed trolling, live bait trolling, deep dropping, free lining, jigging and ect. I absolutely love jigging! It’s such a satisfaction to put in the work and feel the hook up after working the jig. I laugh at myself all the time when I pull out my tackle box full of some many different color and style jigs. It looks like a candy store! I spend more money on jigs than clothes. Hahaha. If you are interested in one of these trips definitely get Book’D as soon as possible for we are booking up quickly, you would need a whole day. Yes, seems like a long time but time flies when you are having fun so it goes by faster than it is.
        
        
        A lot of you ask what I do while I am in Tennessee for the company while I am gone. I am on the website making sure everything is up to date, fulfilling Hook’D merchandise orders, writing blogs, helping with Tik Tok for Hook’D, also making my own (Which a lot think I am acting like a 12 year old) but it’s fun and my kids also enjoy having fun with me. Most of the dances, which I am not that good at dancing, they have taught me lol. I also would like to say, I appreciate all those who do follow and support me, means a lot. I am definitely working on getting more Youtube videos fishing again, it’s been a very busy few months for my company and the weather while I have been in Destin hasn’t been the best on my off days from trips, not to mention we have been so busy! To get Book’D to #fishwithbrit you can call Hook’D at (809)-523-7009 or go to the website, www.dhookchartersinc.com
        
        I am so looking forward to another wonderful year, ready to tackle whatever comes my way. Ready to learn and grow.
